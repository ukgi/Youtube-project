Head to https://keeps.com/SCREENCRUSH to get a special offer.\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania's newest trailer is here, and we have our first clear look at the new big bad of the MCU's multiverse saga, Kang the Conqueror! In this video we talk about Kang's connection to Shang-Chi, Ms. Marvel, and how this all feeds into Avengers: Secret Wars.\n\nThanks for supporting our channel! Check out our MERCH Store Here → https://http://shopzeroedition.com/collections/screen-crush-merch\n\nGo here → http://screencrush.com/\nTikTok → https://www.tiktok.com/@screencrushnews\nLike us → https://www.facebook.com/ScreenCrush\nFollow us → https://twitter.com/screencrushnews\nGet our newsletter → http://screencrush.com/newsletter/\n\nWritten and Hosted by Ryan Arey (http://twitter.com/ryanarey)\nEdited by Harriet Lengel-Enright, Randolf Nombrado, Colton Ogburn, and Ethan Lavinsky\n\n#kang #Quantumania #EasterEggs \n\nI think that Scott Lang is gonna die in this movie. I’ll explain why a little later, and also this trailer seems to confirm some theories weve had about how Kang connects to shang chi, the eternal, and ms marvel. It is all connected. So let's break this thing down.\n \n[trailer opening]. Right off the bat, this is a much darker trailer than what we’re used to seeing in ant man movies. We have the foreboding music, the shot at sunset, as if to say that the sun is setting on score’s time as ant man.  Reminds me a lot of the first trailer for Age of Ultron [clip]. \n\nThe shot is of San Francisco, of course where Ant Man 1 and 2 took place, but also the setting of Shang Chi's opening. That movie was directed by destin daniel cretton, who is now going to helm Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. This is a lot like the Russo brothers, who directed two Captain America films that shaped the final two Avengers films, INfinity war and Secret wars. So Ithink Cretton was chosen because Shang Chi did a lot of the groundwork to set up the Kang Dynasty. Maybe the people of Ta Lo are from alternate timelines, or the quantum realm.\n\nThen we have the mystery of the rings origin and the beacon they send out at the end of the movie, which this trailer gives us a major hint about.\n\nDoug: What is it?\n\nJust be patient, I’m getting there. So we see shots of Scott's life going well for him. In the last trailer we saw that he was given a plaque at the baskin robbins where he was fired [they always find out]. And they even retired his uniform, incorrect name tag and all. Ms marvel mentioned his successful podcast [clip]. And even wakanda forever had a bit on the news ticker about his best selling book, big me little me,\n\nSo Scott is very much taking advantage of his fame, but he still pines for his rosebud, the time he missed in the quantum realm. \n\nKang narrates [you’re an avenger]. And the D23 footage included a line that has not been in a  trailer, where Kang adds “have I killed you before?” which means that kang has killed many versions of the avengers across many realities.\n\nBut he likely has not encountered a scott lang before. And maybe this is why he realizes that Scott is the key to getting what he needs. And to emphasize this, the first shots of Scott as any man show him being really adept at using his powers–he breaks his fall by becoming a giant man. He’s the best he’s ever been at being a hero, and a far cry from this [anyone have any orange slices].\n\nThen we see that, despite his fame and success, Scott really just wants back the time with his daughter. The image of Cassie on his phone is still her as a little girl. And now,in the present day, she’s getting arrested. She has always taken after her dad. And since her dad was locked up in jail, it makes sense that she would follow suit. Except she was probably arrested at a protest of something, judging by her shirt which is anti-global warming.\n\nThe shot of Cassie in prison is intercut with Scott walking toward the camera with the pyms. Cleev framing, because cassie was all alone, while scott was off doing superhero stuff. And this ias kag narrates [but you’ve lost a lot of time]\n\nDoug: yeah what does kang mean by that, lost time?\n\nWell, first let me explain who Kang is in the comics, because that will help you to understand who he is in this movie.",

        "description": "(AP) — The 6-year-old Virginia student who shot and wounded his teacher pulled the handgun from a backpack and shot her while she was teaching his first-grade class, a police chief said.\n\nNewport News Police Chief Steve Drew on Monday offered the first description of how the shooting happened. He had previously said that the shooting was not accidental and declined to elaborate.\n\nHe said the student pulled the gun out, pointed at the teacher and fired at her. He said there was no physical struggle over the gun preceding the gunshot. No students were injured.\n\nDrew said that the gun had been legally purchased by the child’s mother in York County. It was in the child’s residence, he put it in his back pack and brought it to school, the chief said.\n\nThe teacher who was wounded Friday in the shooting, Abby Zwerner, was in stable condition Monday at an area hospital. Describing her as a hero, Drew said he had spoken to her and one of her biggest concerns was for her students.\n\nDrew said after the shooting, the boy was physically restrained by a school employee and that he struck the employee. The boy was taken away in a police car.\n\nA candlelight vigil in honor of Zwerner was planned for Monday at 6:30 p.m.\n\nPrincipal Briana Foster Newton said in an update on the school’s website that the school will be closed for the week.\n\nPolice have declined to describe what led to the altercation or any other details about what happened in the classroom, citing the ongoing investigation. They have also declined to say how the boy got access to the gun or who owns the weapon.\n\nVirginia law does not allow 6-year-olds to be tried as adults. In addition, a 6-year-old is too young to be committed to the custody of the Department of Juvenile Justice if found guilty. Authorities have not specified where the boy was being held.\n\nOn Monday morning, several parents, grandparents and community members gathered with a local pastor in an open patch of grass outside the school.\n\nAmong them was parent Eric Billet, who said each of his three children in the Newport News school system, two of whom go to Richneck, has reacted differently to the shooting.\n\nBillet’s son who is in middle school has raised concerns about school security, telling his dad that he felt safer at theme parks, which the boy argued had better security than his school. His second-grade son is doing better, Billet said, fist-bumping a police officer on his way out of school Friday.\n\nHis daughter, a fourth-grader, has had nightmares every night, Billet said.\n\nBut at the same time, he said, “she was also disappointed she couldn’t go to school this week.”",
